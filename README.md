## 🧠 LLM-Powered Customer Review Insights

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to extract actionable insights from customer reviews. By applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it transforms unstructured feedback into structured, decision-ready insights.

### 🔍 What It Does

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects the emotional tone of each review (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifies recurring themes and subjects customers frequently talk about.
- **Summarization**: Condenses long reviews into short, meaningful summaries to highlight key points.

### 🚀 Why It Matters

Understanding customer sentiment and recurring feedback is critical for product improvement and customer satisfaction. This LLM-powered pipeline helps:

- 🧩 Identify what users love or dislike about a product.
- 📈 Inform product development and UX decisions.
- 🎯 Support marketing and customer support teams with better data.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Numpy
- HuggingFace Transformers / OpenAI API (for LLM tasks)
- Visualization libraries for insights (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
