LLM-Powered Customer Review Insights

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to extract actionable insights from customer reviews. By applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it transforms unstructured feedback into structured, decision-ready insights.

### What It Does

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects the emotional tone of each review (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifies recurring themes and subjects customers frequently talk about.
- **Summarization**: Condenses long reviews into short, meaningful summaries to highlight key points.

### Why It Matters

Understanding customer sentiment and recurring feedback is critical for product improvement and customer satisfaction. This LLM-powered pipeline helps:

- Identify what users love or dislike about a product.
- Inform product development and UX decisions.
- Support marketing and customer support teams with better data.

### Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Numpy
- HuggingFace Transformers / OpenAI API (for LLM tasks)
- Visualization libraries for insights (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
